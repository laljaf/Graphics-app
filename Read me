# Assignement description 

(C#, WinForm)

This assignment requires you to build a basic shape-drawing application from first principles. 
The file GrafPack.cs is provided for you, which contains the partial code for a WinForms application that currently just creates and displays only one square.
You are required to develop the application so that various different shapes can be drawn with these shapes referenced in an array. 
The different shapes should all be defined as classes which inherit from a class Shape. Shapes should be created by discrete mouse clicks or rubber-banding (better). 
The main menu might contain the following options (you may change these if you wish):

-Create: Produces a sub-menu for creation of Square, Circle and Triangle shapes.
-Select: Allows the user to cycle through the shapes using mouse clicks or keyboard, highlighting the selected shape. 
         Alternatively the shape may be selected by clicking on a vertex.
-Transform: If a shape has been selected, this should produce a sub-menu with offerings such as Move and Rotate. 
            The amounts of movement and rotation may be input from the keyboard or via the mouse, including ‘drag and drop’ operations.
-Delete: If a shape has been selected, this will delete it from the screen and from memory.
-Exit: Terminate the program cleanly.

The given classes may be modified, but only modifications for which documentation is supplied will be taken into account for marking. 
The language of implementation must be C# (ensures background equivalence – all students will have studied C#).
Wherever possible you should not use the drawing and processing features of the WinForms GDI or WPF but perform the operations from first principles
using code you have written utilising some of the techniques outlined in this module. 
You may enhance the functionality beyond the above specification to provide added value (see mark scheme).
